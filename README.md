# WiDS Datathon 2025: Unraveling the Mysteries of the Female Brain: Sex Patterns in ADHD

## Team 
This team conists of 4 undergraduate students, all of whom are apart of the Break Through Tech 2024-2025 UCLA cohort.
Team members: Louise Marie Maganto, Souzen Khan, Zuleyka Urieta, Min Aung Paing

## Overview  
This repository contains our submission for the WiDS Datathon 2025, a global data science competition focused on advancing women's brain health research. The data utilized in this challenge was provided by the Healthy Brain Network and the Reproducible Brain Charts.  

This project is part of the **Break Through Tech AI Program** (UCLA site), which empowers students to apply AI/ML techniques to real-world challenges.  

## Challenge Objective  
The goal of this competition is to develop a **multi-outcome machine learning model** that predicts:  
1. **ADHD diagnosis** (1 = Yes, 0 = No)  
2. **Sex** (1 = Female, 0 = Male)  

Predictions are based on **functional brain imaging data, socio-demographic information, emotional factors, and parenting data** from children and adolescents.  

## Real World Significance  
ADHD affects about **11% of adolescents** (14% of boys and 8% of girls). However, girls with ADHD are often underdiagnosed due to differences in symptom presentation. This disparity can lead to **delayed interventions and long-term mental health challenges**.  

By leveraging **AI and machine learning**, we aim to help:  
- Improve **early identification** of ADHD in both males and females  
- Detect patterns to provide insights into **brain activity differences by sex**   ## Team
